# Web Crawler

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Web Crawler project.

## Overview

This project is a simple web crawler that allows you to crawl a website and store the extracted data in a JSON file. Additionally, it provides a search functionality to look for specific strings within the crawled data.

## How to Use

### 1. Crawling

To crawl a website, follow these steps:

- Enter the target website URL.

The crawled data will be saved to a file named `crawler_output.json`.

### 2. Searching

To search for specific strings within the crawled data:

- Enter the search string.
- Click the "Search" button.

The search result, if found, will be displayed.
